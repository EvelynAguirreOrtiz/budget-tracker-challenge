## Description

This is a budget tracker that has both online and offline functionality. The application allows the user to add and subtract funds from their budget whether or not there is an available internet connection.

When transactions are made while the user is offline, the tracker total will update when the application is back online and the user will receive a notification that the transactions have been added to the history.
